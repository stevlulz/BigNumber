# Big Number c/c++

This project is to implement Big number library for c/c++ with all kind of arithmetic operation + / * -
The library is simple, no optimization is done in algorithms.
most algorithms are based on divide and concer.
### Installing
For Pc : 
1 - download lib
2 - Do "make"
For arduino : 
1 - Download lib.
2 - Do "make arduino"
3 - add lib to extern libraries (Arduino Ide)

```
Give the example
```
```
 Bn a;
```

```
Bn b;
```

```
Bn res;
```

```
 parseStrToBN(&b,"12344353464562453245345.12323143241341341234132414");
```

```
parseStrToBN(&a,"3464356347523452314145426345635634563.464563457324134123412341320201032412304");
```

```
 uadd(a,b,&c); // unsigned addition
```

```
 add(a,b,&c); // sign addition
```

```
 umul(a,b,&c); // unsigned multiplication
 ```

 ```
 mul(a,b,&c); // signed multiplication
```


 
```
 mul(a,b,&c); // signed multiplication
```


```
Give an example
```
